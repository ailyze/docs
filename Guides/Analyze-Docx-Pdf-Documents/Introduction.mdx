# Part 1: Project Configuration

### 1.1 Uploading & Defining Scope

The first step is ingesting your data and telling AILYZE what kind of outputs you need.

1.  **Drag and Drop:** Upload your files into the dashboard. You can upload up to **50 files** at once.

    \*   _Note:_ AILYZE supports **Multilingual Analysis**. You can upload interviews in over 100 languages (e.g., Spanish, French, Swahili) and the AI will analyze them and output the results in English (or your preferred language).

2.  **Select Analysis Checkboxes:** You will see four options. We recommend checking all four for a complete study:

    \_✅ \_   \*Get Summary:\*\* Provides Executive and Individual file summaries.

    \_✅ \_   \*Get Themes & Codebook:\*\* Generates the qualitative coding framework.

    \_✅ \_   \*Get Answers to Questions:\*\* Allows you to ask specific research questions, interview questions, and any other relevant questions.

    \_✅ \_   \*Compare across Segments:\*\* _Crucial for researchers._ Allows comparison across segments within your project by gender, ethnicity, or publication date, among others.
